# HSL Stop Browser

This is a simple iOS application that allows users to search for public transport stops in the Helsinki region. The application uses the HSL API to fetch the bus stop data. The user can search for bus stops by looking around the map, and see the timetable for a specific stop. The map is powered by the Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS.
